# Gian's collection of UI Design / Development projects

It has been recently converted from plain HTML / CSS / JS to React for better components organization and for being one of the most used library in 2021 - a technology I've used a lot in my projects.

## What can we find there?

A simple header, a couple of sentences about me, a list of the most relevant projects I've built in the past couple of years and a contact form (powered by Formspree - a service for sending emails).

## Cool! But which projects are there, then?

### **[Carousel Learning](https://www.carousel-learning.com/)**

> Carousel is an online tool that helps students to embed knowledge in their long-term memory.

Carousel was the biggest projects I've built while working with [Aircury](https://www.aircury.com/). This project was originally a spreadsheet pilot called the Retrieval Roulette developed by [Adam Boxer](https://twitter.com/adamboxer1).

After that, with a grant from Innovate UK, they've been able to take things to the next level, and build a program that will make a huge difference to student learning with minimal hassle for hardworking teachers.

Unfortunately, I cannot show the source code of that project. However, you can ask me for a demo or find yourself everything you need on Carousel's [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYW4FlFhLfrK2T31Q0Aj4Lg)

I started designing the interface based on some UX suggestions that were given me by the Ed-Tech expert [Joshua Perry](https://twitter.com/bringmoredata) and an initial idea of how they had in mind the interface could look like.

The project was divided in 3 main sectors that had to be independently designed:

1. The **Landing Page**, to showcase the product to teachers and institutions.
2. The **Teachers' Dashboard**, to manage quizzes, question banks and classes.
3. The **Students' Quiz Area**, to practice (based on the spaced repetition principle - reflected in the UI as flipping cards) or to take quizzes.

After an initial draft of the Landing Page, we already started identifying the core visual identity for the whole application.
The style of the buttons, the fonts choice, the colors and the shadows, were all contributing to the final version of the design system.
