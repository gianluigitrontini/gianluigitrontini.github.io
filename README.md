# Gian's collection of UI Design / Development projects

> It has been recently converted from plain HTML / CSS / JS to React for better components organization and for being one of the most used library in 2021 - a technology I've used a lot in my projects.

## Cool! Which projects are there?

<sup>1</sup> I was not in charge of the back-end development; credit goes to [Daniel](https://github.com/xDaizu).  

My main project with Aircury has been Carousel Learning. I was in charge of the whole design and development of the UI - initially assisted by other more experienced developers until I was able to autonomously work on the codebase.

This project was funded by a UK Government grant and was based on the previous work done by Adam Boxer - whose project was already used by thousands of teachers. We planned everything taking into account having a lot of users since day zero of production.

It’s divided in two parts. A dashboard for teachers where they can manage classes, question banks and creating quizzes and a quiz + revision section for students integrating the concept of spaced repetition.

=> Logo design + Branding

=> Landing page

=> UI Development for teachers and students.

### [School Verify](https://www.aircury.com/verify) & [Connector](https://www.aircury.com/connector)

Aircury’s own products.
There was a need to modernize their product branding and creating logos and simple landing pages to display on their website.

The process consisted of gathering all the informations about the products, creating the logos and designing illustrations (including animations as it was the only requirement apart from keeping Aircury’s branding) and finally upload everything on the actual website which was built on top of Symfony - a PHP framework - which required further research from my side.

=> Logo design + Illustrations

=> Landing pages design and development

### RiseRosaRage - *work in progress*

A project used to display a huge vintage poster collection with the ability for the owner to autonomously upload every piece, add them to custom collections, create blog posts. It also featured a dynamic map displaying the orginal location and informations about the pieces in a selected collection.

I was helped with the backend by my colleague, but had to make changes as the project was progressing and features were added. The owner had a very rough idea of what to include in the website - so part of my job was coming up with ideas, present them, create the initial designs (wireframes and prototypes of the pages + assets design) and code the frontend.

=> Website design and ideation of features

=> Assets Design

=> Frontend development
