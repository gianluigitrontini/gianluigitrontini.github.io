<p>Entrelibros is Spanish alternative to Goodreads. Here you can find a lot of reviews about books, and you can even submit your own.</p>
<p>The project was built using Symfony, and the frontend relies on Twig - a PHP template engine. For styling, we used SCSS and Tailwind.</p>
<p>At first, when I was handed the project, most of the UI Elements were already built by my colleague Elena. However, important features were missing and the layout was not responsive.</p>
<p>One of the first things I focused on was building the Carousel for showing all the new book in specific categories in the Homepage. I relied on a library for the scroll-on-the-X-axis gestures. I made the distinction of what can be hovered and what canâ€™t. On mobile, the title and the author, were placed below the book cover. On desktop, it appears while hovering.</p>

<p>Also the book/author page had to be designed and developed from scratch.</p> </section> </main> </div> </div> <div class="lg:w-1/3 flex flex-col fixed left-0 lg:left-auto right-0 bottom-0 lg:top-0"> <div class="previous-next-gradient flex-1 flex flex-col justify-between bg-gray-50 p-4 lg:pt-8"> <div class="hidden md:flex flex-col flex-1 gap-4"> <img src="/images/projects/logos/entrelibros-logo.png" class="mr-auto max-w-[12rem] h-20 object-contain" alt=""> <div class="text-left w-full"> <span class="font-medium"> <a href="https://entrelibros.net" class="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <h3 class="text-xl">EntreLibros</h3>  </a> </span> <p class="text-gray-500">Find new adventures on paper; Recommend your favorite book to your friends; Do you remember that one they told you about?
